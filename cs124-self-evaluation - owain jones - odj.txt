Year:       2010 - 2011

Module:     CS124

Assignment Number:         1


Assignment Description:    Group Project - Comic Book Maker GUI written in Java



Worth 20% of final mark for this module


How many hours (approx.) did you spend on this assignment? 40


Expected Letter Grade:    B


   And why?

I think I showed a good grasp of how to use Java's OO concepts such as interfaces
and extension, general user interface design ideas, and the internal workings of Swing.

I implemented lots of features in the code of our project, and hopefully my code is
designed to be easily extendable in future. I've had plenty of fun making comics and
images in the application!


What did you Learn? 
Lots about GUI design patterns, how to build thread-safe UI applications using Java
and Swing, lots about how Java's garbage collection works (we use it heavily due
to how we do undo & redo etc.)

I also learnt how we can work as a group and play to our strengths! Matthew being excellent
at trawling the web for images, drawing them by hand in crayon, etc., and Dean coming up with
general ideas for the project which I then wanted to implement (some of which are still in the
todo list in Run.java of the source code).
