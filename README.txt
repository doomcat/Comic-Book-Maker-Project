This is the Git repository for our Comic Book project.
(Code by Owain Jones, Dean Allen and Matthew Hathaway)
-----

The app can be ran in its JAR form by running comicbookmaker.jar
The app can also be ran from bin/Run.class (java bin/Run)
And the source is in src/

Put assets (images to drag and drop onto canvas) in assets folder.
It doesn't scan assets/ itself, only its subdirectories, so make yourself
a new folder or put your assets (preferably transparent .png images) in
an existing folder.
