The app can be ran in its JAR form by running comicbookmaker.jar in the root
of the directory.
And the source is in src/

Put assets (images to drag and drop onto canvas) in assets folder.
It doesn't scan assets/ itself, only its subdirectories, so make yourself
a new folder or put your assets (preferably transparent .png images) in
an existing folder.

WARNING: The JAR file won't run without an external assets folder with
content, so don't delete or move the 'assets' folder, or move the JAR file
from the folder this is extracted to.
